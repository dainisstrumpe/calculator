## Task
TODO - What is the problem? And where is the challenge?

Create a single route ReactJS application. Application should be able to perform all simple operations like:
+-/*. It should display result of operation and should be able to clear the buffer.

Project should be hosted in the cloud (AWS/Gcloud/Azure/Netlify/...)

## Description
TODO - How have you solved the problem?

The project is a simple calculator build using ReactJS and styled with CSS. 
It uses the useState to manage user input and display. It uses mathjs library to evaluate mathematical expressions.
The calculator is made in single component Calculator.js that:
    - renders the UI for digits and operations;
    - handles button click event;
    - evaluates expressions and updates the display;
    - clears the input.

Design is made in App.css file.

As I couldn't make it run in Do Code, I worked on the code of calculator locally on my pc in VS code and 
saved my work on my github account. Calculator repository: https://github.com/dainisstrumpe/calculator
